SMART BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Project Description:
This project is a working prototype of a Smart Battery Management System (SBMS) using NodeMCU ESP8266, a TP4056 charging module, and a 3.7V Li-ion battery. The system is designed to monitor and optimize battery charging, discharging, and overall health.

Components Used:

* NodeMCU ESP8266
* TP4056 Battery Charging Module
* 3.7V Li-ion Rechargeable Battery
* Breadboard
* Connecting Wires
* USB cable for power

Key Features:

* Voltage Monitoring
* Current Sensing
* Charging and Discharging Control
* Battery Health Monitoring
* Wi-Fi Connectivity for Data Sharing (using ESP8266)

How it Works:

1. The Li-ion battery is connected to the TP4056 module for safe charging.
2. The TP4056 module is interfaced with the NodeMCU through a breadboard.
3. The NodeMCU collects battery data (voltage, current status).
4. This data can be sent over Wi-Fi to a web dashboard or IoT platform for analysis.
5. Alerts can be triggered for overcharge, deep discharge, or unusual behavior.

Advantages:

* Increases battery life through smart charge control
* Ensures safety during battery use
* Allows real-time monitoring
* Can be integrated into solar, wind, or smart grid systems

Applications:

* Renewable energy systems (solar/wind/hydro)
* Electric vehicles
* IoT devices
* Backup power systems

Future Scope:

* Use of AI for predictive maintenance
* Integration with smart homes or microgrids
* Real-time data visualization on mobile apps or dashboards

Instructions:
Connect all components as shown in the image. Upload firmware to the NodeMCU using Arduino IDE. Use Wi-Fi credentials and a cloud platform like ThingSpeak or Blynk for data logging.

Note:
Make sure all battery connections are secure to avoid short circuits.
